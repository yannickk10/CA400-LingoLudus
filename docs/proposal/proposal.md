## SECTION B


### Introduction


The project that we have decided to do is based around three different areas; Web Development, Data Analytics, Predictive algorithms. We decided to go into these three areas as they are areas that we have the most interest in.

Web design has always been one of the more fun but also challenging things that we could do. This being the case we chose to do it as it would allow us to do something that would test our ability as software engineers yet also give us a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

We decided to add aspects such as Data analytics and Predictive algorithms as we fee that a simple web app would not be a good display of the knowledge that we have accumulated over the course of our degree at DCU.


### Outline


The project is a WebApp called NBA Datum . We are developing a web app based around the NBA that would display different stats for players and teams alike in the NBA. The web app would also feature a data dashboard in which users would be able to see data such as what side of the court a player has been taking better shots from. Below we go a little more in depth on what each aspect of the web app may entail.

- Web Development:

The web  development aspect of the project is very important. The other components such as the data dashboard and the predictive algorithms will be hosted on the WebApp. This makes the WebAp responsible for being a central hub for all the componenets that will be introduced in our project.

- Data Analytics

The data analytics portion of the project falls under the kinds of data that we will be displaying with the data dashboard. Certain statistics such as number of shots made when a  players team was winning as opposed to shots made when a players team was losing are not generally shown. Analysing the data, we have at hand to get this kind of statistic could help to ow how some players may perform under pressure.

- Predictive Algorithms 

Predictive algorithms tie into our Data Analytics. We will be using data that we have collected from the NBA to try and piece together trends in certain scenarios such as factors that add to a team winning the NBA playoffs or factors that lead a player winning the MVP award.


### Background

The Ideas for our Project cam from both our passion for sport our love for web design and our experience from intra in 3rd year. Both of us are very interested in the sport of Basketball and thought that this would be a good way to get fans even more engaged in discussion surrounding the NBA as well as giving more professional figures such as scouts an informative and easy to read platform to view statistics on the league.

### Achievements

The Project will aim to provide many different features such as live match updates and league fixtures, NBA team and player statistics, a data dashboard to easily view stats in an informative way and predictive statistics for the NBAâ€™s foreseeable future.

The users in question will be the general populous of people interested in the NBA as well as team scouts for teams in the league. 


### Justification

The project will be useful as people interested in the league will be able to get key information on all the teams and players that they love. It can also be used by said people to collect accurate information in which they can use while discussing Basketball with their friends or colleagues on a day-to-day basis.

### Programming language(s)

Python3, PyDash, Heroku, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Programming tools / Tech stack

Git, Pyunit for testing , JEST for front end testing, Gitlab Projects, NBA_API(undecided)

### Hardware

N/A

### Learning Challenges

Full stack development, data modelling, data visualisation, data prediction.

### Breakdown of work

It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for separate, clearly defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required for the project.

Documentation for the project will be split evenly between both students to give a fair portion of work and experience to each of them. 

Data analytics will be manned by Yann as he has good experience with this thanks to his internship. Although Fawwaz will still handle some of the analysis and learn how to go about doing so from Yann. Working like this will allow both students to learn as one will gain a better understanding of data analysis by teaching it whilst the other will be able to learn about it from somebody who has experienced it in the working industry.

The web design aspect will be split more or less evenly between the two students, having a few pages given to each student to be created along with the css styling for said pages.

The PyDash Dashboards will be split between each student evenly to give both a fair chance to learn the new software and add to their library of knowledge.

Predictive algorithms for the statistics will also be split evenly in work to give a fair chance to both students to learn such a new concept. This will be especially beneficial because it will help both students learn to think in different ways as well as learn different algorithms that go into predictive learning.
