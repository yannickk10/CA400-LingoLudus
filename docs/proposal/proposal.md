### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

The project that we have decided to do is based around three different areas; Web Development, Data Analytics, Predictive algorithms. We decided to go into these three areas as they are areas that we have the most interest in.

Web design has always been one of the more fun but also challenging things that we could do. This being the case we chose to do it as it would allow us to do something that would test our ability as software engineers yet also give us a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

We decided to add aspects such as Data analytics and Predictive algorithms as we fee that a simple web app would not be a good display of the knowledge that we have accumulated over the course of our degree at DCU.


### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

The project is a WebApp called __________ . We are developing a web app based around the NBA that would display different stats for players and teams alike in the NBA. The web app would also feature a data dashboard in which users would be able to see data such as what side of the court a player has been taking better shots from. Below we go a little more in depth on what each aspect of the web app may entail.

- Web Development:

The web  development aspect of the project is very important. The other components such as the data dashboard and the 


- Data Analytics

The data analytics portion of the project falls under the kinds of data that we will be displaying with the data dashboard. Certain statistics such as number of shots made when a  players team was winning as opposed to shots made when a players team was losing are not generally shown. Analysing the data, we have at hand to get this kind of statistic could help to ow how some players may perform under pressure.

- Predictive Algorithms 

Predictive algorithms tie into our Data Analytics. We will be using data that we have collected from the NBA to try and piece together trends in certain scenarios such as factors that add to a team winning the NBA playoffs or factors that lad t a player winning the MVP award.


### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
