## SECTION B

> Guidance: This document is expected to be approximately 3 pages in length, but it can exceed this page limit.
> It is also permissible to carry forward content from this proposal to your later documents (e.g. functional
> specification) as appropriate.

> Your proposal must include *at least* the following sections.


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

The project that we have decided to do is based around three different areas; Web Development, Data Analytics, Predictive algorithms. We decided to go into these three areas as they are areas that we have the most interest in. Web design has always been one of the more fun but also challenging things that we could do. This being the case we chose to do it as it would allow us to do something that would test our ability as software engineers yet also give us a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. We decided to add aspects such as Data analytics and Predictive algorithms as we fee that a simple web app would not be a good display of the knowledge that we have accumulated over the course of our degree at DCU.


### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
